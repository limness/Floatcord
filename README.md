# File sharing system
__Floatcord__ â€” This is a convenient service for quick data exchange between users, and most importantly, it does not require any authorization or registration. We are against all those nerdy dialog boxes that ask you to enter all your personal information, our system is more sophisticated.

## Channel System
For data exchange we have implemented a special system of channels. Users can create hundreds of different channels and upload their own data there, and then share unique keys with friends to gain access to them. 

Another interesting feature is the access identifiers. They are necessary to get rid of the boring links nobody is interested in. You can generate a normal key which consists of numbers, then pass it to another person and he will see all your downloaded files. 

## Chat system
In addition to data exchange, users can communicate freely with each other within the created channel.

## Editor Code
You heard right. For us, as programmers, an important goal was to implement our own code editor, where we could quickly upload the latest versions of algorithms and other systems. GitHub will say, "Why reinvent the wheel, there's me!" However, our helper wins in terms of time - just one click and your code changes are seen by all users who are on the channel. 

## Desktop
One of the main advantages of file sharing is its desktop version for the Windows operating system. The program allows you literally in two clicks (Ctrl + V) to open your previously created channel and download files (And all this again does not require any authorization or registration). The desktop version provides all the same features as the full version of the site.
